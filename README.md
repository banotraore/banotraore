Hi,
I'm Bano (pronounce: bä nō)

After a bootcamp, self and peer-learning I’ve became a Fullstack Developer Rails/React

- I'm an ex International French-Malian athlete in 110m hurdles #HurdlesGang 
- I'm a volunteer coach for my track team. (check my app for organizing my athletes trainings https://github.com/banotraore/track_my_trainings)
